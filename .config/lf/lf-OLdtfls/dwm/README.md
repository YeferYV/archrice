### Mouse bindings

I would like to have some mouse-friendly features, so in my fork you can click/scroll
on some regions in the status bar to trigger some actions (it's a little bit messy, tho)

| region         | Button 1  | Button 3    | Button 4  | Button 5  |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| tags           | switch    | toggle      | next      | previous  |
| layout         | next      | previous    | next      | previous  |
| title          |           | goto master | next      | previous  |
| (status below) | -         | -           | -         | -         |
| memory         |           | top by mem  |           |           |
| cpu            |           | top by cpu  |           |           |
| volume         | toggle    | alsamixer   | up        | down      |
| brightness     |           |             | up        | down      |
| network        | show info | nmtui       |           |           |
| battery        | show info |             |           |           |
| notifications  |           |             | show more | show less |
| run            | rofi run  |             |           |           |
| search         | rofi drun | xmenu       |           |           |
